ANALYSIS: ⁠For unsorted arrays: Timsort outperforms both Insertion and Merge sort.
⁠For partially sorted arrays: Timsort still has the lowest execution time, followed by Merge and then Incertion sort.
⁠For sorted arrays: Timsort remains the fastest, with Insertion slightly slower, and Merge sort being the slowest among the three.
For the data sest bigger than 100 numbers in a list, Insertion sort proves to be the least efficient in the case of unsorted or partially sorted arrays.
