ANALYSIS: ⁠For unsorted arrays: Timsort outperforms both Insertion and Merge sort.
⁠For partially sorted arrays: Timsort still has the lowest execution time, followed by Merge and then Incertion sort.
⁠For sorted arrays: Timsort remains the fastest, with Merge slightly slower, and Insertion sort being the slowest among the three.
For the data sest bigger than 100 numbers in list, Insertion sort proves to be the least efficient in the case of unsorted or partially sorted arrays.
